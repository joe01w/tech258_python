# JSON

## What is it?

**JS** - JavaScript <br>
**O** - Object <br>
**N** - Notation

JSON is a syntax for exchanging data between 
a browser/client and server.

It is really popular because it is considered system agnostic. It doesn't really matter what the two systems
are written in. They can both exchange JSON.

Documentation for working with JSON in Python found [here.](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html)

## JSON Syntax

Data is in name/value pairs:

```
"Name":"Value"
```

Curly Braces hold objects:

```
{"Name":"Value}
```

Data can be separated by commas:

```
{"Name1":"Value1", "Name2":"Value2"}
```

Square Brackets can be used for arrays (lists of data):

```
{"Name":["Value1", "Value2"]}
```
